# Deloitte March Data Crunch Madness 2022

Our team, Bracket Busters, competed in Deloitte's March Madness Competition (https://www.fordham.edu/gabelli-school-of-business/industry-collaborations/engagement-and-expertise-/march-data-crunch-madness/)

Our team cleaned and wrangled data, created new variables and developed predictive models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest) that outputted the percentage chance each team had of winning a game (over 2200 outcomes). We took this very technical initiative and code and presented our findings to technical and non-technical judges from Deloitte ultimately placing 4th out of the entire competition.

This was our first crack at building machine learning models and the competition was an extracurricular activity. It required alot of learning, time, effort and ultiamtely fun. As a team, we had a strong showing in the technical portion and an even stronger showing in the presentation portion.

Enjoy!
